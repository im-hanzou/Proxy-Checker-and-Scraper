------------------------------------------
A very fast automatic proxy scraper and checker. Works as soon as all requirements are installed. Can scrape avout 70k-80k proxies in a few seconds and can scrape about 20 proxies a second. That's about 70k-80k proxies in about 5-8 minutes.

USAGE (WINDOWS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------

1. In the same directory as the requirements.txt file, run: py -m pip install requirements.txt.
2. Run the python file.
3. After all the file exit exits, just run the cleanup.py file (make sure it's in the same directory as proxy_scraper.py). This removes all duplicates and unnecessary white spaces.
